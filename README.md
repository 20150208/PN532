## NFC library for Arduino

This is an Arduino library for PN532 to use NFC technology. It's based on 
[Adafruit_NFCShield_I2C](http://goo.gl/pk3FdB)
and improved by [Seeed Studio](http://goo.gl/zh1iQh).
It works with

+ [NFC Shield](http://goo.gl/Cac2OH)
+ [PN532 NFC/RFID controller breakout board](http://goo.gl/tby9Sw)

### Features
+ Support I2C and SPI of PN532
+ Read/write Mifare Classic Card
+ Works with [Don's NDEF Library](http://goo.gl/jDjsXl)

### Getting Started
1. Download [zip file](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/PN532/archive/master.zip) and 
extract the three folders(PN532, PN532_SPI and PN532_I2C) into libraries of Arduino.
2. Follow the examples of the library


### Doing
+ Peer to peer communication
+ Ported to [mbed platform](http://goo.gl/WHtyuH)


### To do
+ Card emulation
