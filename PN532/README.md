## NFC library for Arduino

This is an Arduino library for PN532 to use NFC technology. It's based on 
[Adafruit_NFCShield_I2C](http://goo.gl/pk3FdB)
and improved by [Seeed Studio](http://goo.gl/zh1iQh).
It works with:

+ [Elechouse NFC Module](http://goo.gl/i0EQgd)
+ [NFC Shield](http://goo.gl/Cac2OH)
+ [Xadow NFC](http://goo.gl/qBZMt0)
+ [PN532 NFC/RFID controller breakout board](http://goo.gl/tby9Sw)

### Features
+ Support I2C and SPI of PN532
+ Read/write Mifare Classic Card
+ Works with [Don's NDEF Library](http://goo.gl/jDjsXl)
+ Support Peer to Peer communication(exchange data with android 4.0+)
+ Support [mbed platform](http://goo.gl/kGPovZ)

### Getting Started
1. Download [zip file](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/PN532/archive/master.zip) and 
extract the three folders(PN532, PN532_SPI and PN532_I2C) into libraries of Arduino.
2. Follow the examples of the library


### To do
+ Card emulation
